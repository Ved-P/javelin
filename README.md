## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Javelin (Java Language Interpreter) is an interpreter for coders to program in Java, similar to how Shell works in Python. Javelin allows coders to check their code and run it on the spot, without having to scavenge through compiler errors or to test code in a different language.

Javelin is a running project, and more features like OOP and block coding will be developed very soon. Javelin also appreciates contributions from users in the open-source community on GitHub. If you would like to contribute, checkout the contribution guidelines!

## Getting Started

Are you interested in using Javelin? The installation process is quick and easy! Just follow the prerequisites and installation procedures that follow.

### Prerequisites

To run Javelin, you will need to have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your computer. A JRE can be installed through [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html).

**Note:** If you would also like to code with Java using Java files, a JRE is not sufficient for your needs. You need to download a Java Development Kit (JDK), which can also be downloaded through Oracle.

### Installation

1. Download `Javelin.jar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/Ved-P/javelin/blob/main/Javelin.jar).
2. Open a terminal window, such as Command Prompt for windows.
3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded 'Javelin.jar'. In Command Prompt:
   ```sh
   cd C:\MyDirectory
   ```
4. Execute the jar file using the following command:
   ```sh
   java -jar Javelin.jar
   ```

## Usage

This section will be added once the project gets going!
<!-- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ -->
