## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Javelin (Java Language Interpreter) is an interpreter for coders to program in Java, similar to how Shell works in Python. Javelin allows coders to check their code and run it on the spot, without having to scavenge through compiler errors or to test code in a different language.

Javelin is a running project, and more features like OOP and block coding will be developed very soon. Javelin also appreciates contributions from users in the open-source community on GitHub. If you would like to contribute, checkout the contribution guidelines!
